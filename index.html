            <h2>> latest blog post</h2> <h3>Jan 30th, 2022</h3><div id="blogscroll"><p>I spent the day learning about some new ways to style my webpage using CSS and that is with the help of the flex attribute! As of time of writing, approximately 1pm EST, I only have a layout that plays nice with a higher desktop resolution. It took me a while to properly grasp how to use flex but I think it's a nice way to arrange a decent mix of various columns/width boxes. I wanted to make sure the blog post section, at least on a larger screen, has enough height that one could read an entire post, or at least most of the post, without having to do much scrolling.<p><p>I also learned about importing font-awesome icons which is insanely handy. When I started, I had the mindset that I would be designing everything from scratch but it seems, with the help of various tools and frameworks, I really only have to adapt existing styles/designs to suit my needs.</p><p>CSS is extremely handy for styling pages without having to alter the underlying html however, as there are so many different devices and layouts, you're essentially creating multiple designs to target specific device sets. This means designing a webpage essentially requires that you design the same page multiple times. I'll have to get used to creating designs before hand because up until now I've just been making it up as I go. I can definitely see how having design software with preset heights and widths for specific devices can come in handy. I know nobody reads this but if you have suggestions for intuitive design software let me know. OH I KNOW, I'LL ASK GOOSE!.. FFW 2 mins later: Goose didn't have the answer I was hoping for. :( Oh well. As you can see, I often type my thoughts out quite literally. Sometimes I speak them out loud too. It definitely helps me focus my thoughts into more concrete ideas.</p><p>Well, I've rambled on long enough.</p><p>Learning all the various attributes and how they work is definitely going to take some time so I'm going to take a short break and do some working out. Gotta stay in shape!</p></div>
