<p>
<b>Technical Specialist</b> – Responsible for resolving and noting technical issues with customer’s Apple
devices in store while maintaining an overall interaction time average of 15 minutes. Making decisions
as to when hardware replacement solutions are needed. Working with other teams to provide unique
solutions when needed. Maintaining Apple level customer service is a top priority of course.
</p>

<b>Specialist</b> – Responsible for providing Apple level customer service while discovering customer’s needs
and advising for the best product solutions within the customer’s budget, including setting up carrier
contracts and promoting Apple services, such as business solutions, learning to use products, Apple
Music, Apple TV, Apple News+, Apple iCloud, Apple Arcade.
</p>

<p>
<b>Order Support</b> – During the pandemic, I quickly pivoted to a new work from home role whereby I was
meeting customer’s needs for the online store. As such, I quickly learned to use SAP as well as other
solutions to communicate directly with shipping carriers and phone carriers to provide Apple level
customer service.

<p>
<b>Shift Leader</b> – Due to my past experience working in a Second Cup, I quickly became a shift leader and the main
store closer 5 days a week. As a shift leader I was responsible for myself and those working with me, I
also took care of the deposits and made sure everything was running smoothly while I was on shift,
quickly taking care of any problems that should arise.
